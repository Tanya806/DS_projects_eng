# Choosing a Region for the Development of New Oil Fields

Let's say you work for a mining company. We need to decide where to drill a new well.
The steps for choosing a location are usually as follows:
- In the selected region, characteristics for wells are collected: oil quality and the volume of its reserves;
- Build a model to predict the volume of reserves in new wells;
- Choose the wells with the highest value estimates;
- Determine the region with the maximum total profit of selected wells.

You have been provided with oil samples in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. Build a model to determine the region where mining will bring the most profit. 
Analyze possible profits and risks using the Bootstrap technique.
