# Gold recovery rate prediction

It is required to build a model that should predict the recovery factor of gold from gold ore. We have data with the parameters of mining and ore refining.
The model will help to optimize production in order not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.

The work uses the following knowledge of the technological process of recovering gold from gold ore.

## Description of the stages of the technological process:

### 1. Flotation (primary ore processing)
A crushed mixture of gold-bearing ore is fed into the flotation plant. After enrichment, a rough concentrate and “dump tails” are obtained, that is, product residues with a low concentration of valuable metals.
The stability of this process is affected by the unstable and non-optimal physico-chemical state of the flotation pulp (a mixture of solid particles and liquid).

### 2. Cleaning
The crude concentrate goes through two stages of purification. At the output of the second stage, the final concentrate is obtained. At each stage, new dump tailings appear.
