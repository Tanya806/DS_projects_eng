# Predicting the Number of Taxi Orders

The Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak period, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.
The value of the RMSE metric on the test sample should be no more than 48.

You need:

Load the data and resample it one hour at a time.
Analyze data.
Train different models with different hyperparameters. Make a test sample of 10% of the original data.
Check the data on the test sample and draw conclusions.
The data is in the taxi.csv file. The number of orders is in the num_orders column (from the English number of orders, “number of orders”).
