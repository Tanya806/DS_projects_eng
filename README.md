## [Исследование надёжности заёмщиков для банка](https://github.com/Tanya806/DS_projects_eng/tree/main/Project%201_Research%20on%20the%20reliability%20of%20borrowers)

#### Brief description
The customer of the project is the credit department of a commercial bank. It is required to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the project will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model, a system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.
