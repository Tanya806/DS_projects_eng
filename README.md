## 11. [Predicting the Number of Taxi Orders](https://github.com/Tanya806/DS_projects_eng/tree/main/Project%2011_Predicting%20the%20Number%20of%20Taxi%20Orders)
#### Brief description
There is historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak period, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. We need to build a model for such a prediction.
